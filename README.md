# Programmer De-Anonymizer

“Programmer De-Anonymizer” is a project that aims to develop a model to identify programmers based on their coding style using static code analysis and includes an innovative feature to match statistical data with stock images representing coding style icons. The model will provide a similarity score indicating how closely a programmer’s coding style aligns with a specific style icon. This project will help us in a forensic context, such as detection of ghostwriting, a form of plagiarism.


## Features

- De-anonymize a programmer based on their coding style.
- Provide a similarity score indicating how closely a programmer's coding style aligns with a specific style icon.
